                    <h3>5 Components of Physical Fitness </h3>
                    <p style={{ color: "darkgreen" }}>The 5 components of physical fitness are often used in our school systems,
                        health clubs and fitness
                        centers to gauge how good a shape we are truly in. The 5 components that make up total fitness are:

                        <li><b style={{ color: "darkmagenta" }}>Cardiovascular Endurance:</b><br />This particularly refers to the
                            potential of the respiratory
                            and the circulatory systems to send
                            oxygen levels to the body parts when under physical activity. Measured using the VO2 MAX test,
                            this is highly important in determining the lung capacity of the individual.

                            <b style={{ color: "darkmagenta" }}>Muscular Strength:</b><br />It is the amount of force a muscle can
                            produce. Examples would be
                            the bench press, leg press or bicep curl. The push up test is most often used to test muscular
                            strength.

                            <b style={{ color: "darkmagenta" }}>Muscular endurance:</b><br />It is the ability of the muscles to
                            perform continuous without
                            fatiguing. Examples would be cycling, step machines and elliptical machines. The sit up test is
                            most often used to test muscular endurance.
                        </li><br />

                            <b style={{ color: "darkmagenta" }}>Flexibility:</b><br />This refers to the degree of motion
                            variation, especially in the joints.
                            Though flexibility cannot be measured superficially, stretches help one find out, how well a
                            particular joint imbibes flexibility. It is one influencing factor that determines how well the
                            other body functions are coordinated to the best of perfection.

                            <b style={{ color: "darkmagenta" }}>Body Composition:</b><br />This basically refers to the relative
                            level of muscle, fat, bones,
                            and other vital elements of the body. Measured using skin fold measuring calipers, DEXA, etc, it
                            plays a highly significant role in determining the strength to weight ratio for better
                            performance levels of the body in the day to day activities.
